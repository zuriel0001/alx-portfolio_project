            <h3>What are the Rules of Rock Paper Scissors?</h3>
            <p>The game has three (3) simple and straightforward rules :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rock wins against scissors.</li>
                <li>Scissors win against paper.</li>
                <li>Paper wins against rock.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If both players make the same gesture, it is a tie, and the game is played again. The game is typically played in a best-of-three or best-of-five format.</p>
